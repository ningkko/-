Koutenn is running! Catch her!\
There are 8 of us you can select to catch Koutenn.
1. When you're using Ning, you can move faster after pressing j. After using the technique the player has to wait for 300 frames for the next use.
2. When using Ewon, you can set obstacles, 3 at a time. You have to wait for 60 frames for the next use.
3. When using Maomao, you can just stand there and attract iris. After 100 frames the tech will disappear and another 300 frames are needed for the next use.
4. When using Nox, you have 50% chance to make either Nox or Iris sleep for 100 frames. Another 300 frames are needed for using the tech again.
5. When using Molly, you can decrease Iris's speed to half of the original speed after standing for 100 frames. Iris will remain the slower speed for 100 frames and then another 300 frames are needed for reusing the tech.
6. When using Elaine, you can change Iris' x position pressing j and y position pressing k.
7. When using Ray, player can change Ray's x position pressing j and y position pressing k.
8. When using Abby, after standing for 50 frame, you can move to the place near where iris was.

## Note
1. Ewon might get stuck by obstacles set by herself.
2. Ray can't move to a place with obstacles.
3. Abby might get stuck by obstacles after moving but she can wait and move again by using her technique to get out of the obstacle.
